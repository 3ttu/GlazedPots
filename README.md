## General information

This mod is based on a suggestion from the subreddit r/minecraftsuggestions: [Glazed Flowerpot: A Wandering Trader Exclusive Item](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/p2qydx/glazed_flowerpot_a_wandering_trader_exclusive_item/)

GlazedPots is meant to be a very light vanilla+ mod. It adds glazed flower pots in the 16 different glazed terracotta variants.

These glazed flower pots are meant to be a rare collectible item for decoration. The pots are only obtainable by trading with the Wandering Trader.

The Wandering trader will always offer one of the 16 different flower pots.

## FAQ

* Q: Will there be a fabric version?
* A: Eventually. When I finished the forge version I will look into it.


* Q: Can you port this mod to version xy (where xy < 1.16.5)?
* A: Probably not. I will focus on versions 1.16.5+.


* Q: Will there be a way to craft the glazed pots? Obtaining them in large quantities for building is a pain!
* A:  I'm considering adding a configurable crafting recipe. This will be disabled by default, though.
